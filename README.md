# dream_beat_aml
This repository contains scripts for training models for the Dream BEAT AML challenge, https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn20940518/wiki/596265. 

In order to run the models you must have access to the training data through participation in the challenge. These must be kept in the ExternalData subfolder. Models were trained using code in the scripts/train_glmnet.Rmd (SC1) and scripts/train_surv.Rmd (SC2) Rmarkdown files. These contain multiple models, but final models are highlighted with a comment.
